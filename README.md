Leaflet EdgeMarker for Greenpeace Mapping
=========================================

Leaflet EdgeMarker is a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugin to show off-screen markers on the edge of the map

This fork of Gerald Pape's original plugin was created to add:

 * L.divIcons instead of L.icons for customisation in CSS
 * installation via [Bower](http://bower.io)
 * build and quality control with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
