Leaflet EdgeMarker for Greenpeace Mapping
=========================================

Leaflet EdgeMarker is a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugin which allows you to indicate Markers, 
Circles and CircleMarkers that are outside of the current view by displaying CircleMarkers at the edges of the map.

This fork of Gerald Pape's original plugin was created to add 
 * transitions on map move
 * superimposed icons on the edge markers
 * installation via Bower
 * building via Grunt
